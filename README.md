## Why Prasmoid?

While the core structure of KDE Plasma plasmoids is straightforward, the surrounding development workflowâ€”including setup, building, testing, and deploymentâ€”often involves repetitive manual steps. **Prasmoid CLI** is designed to abstract away these complexities. It's a powerful command-line tool, crafted with Go, that provides a seamless, integrated experience, allowing you to **focus solely on writing your plasmoid's code**.

**Focus on your code, not the boilerplate.** Prasmoid handles the heavy lifting, from project scaffolding and live previews to smart versioning and packaging, allowing you to concentrate on creating amazing plasmoids.

One of its most revolutionary features is a **built-in, zero-dependency JavaScript runtime**. This allows you to extend the CLI with your own custom commands, automating any workflow imaginable, directly within your project â€“ no Node.js installation required!

## Key Features

*   **Project Scaffolding (`init`)**: Kickstart your plasmoid projects in seconds with a fully structured and ready-to-go template.
*   **Live Preview & Hot Restart (`preview`)**: Test your plasmoid in real-time using `plasmoidviewer` with automatic window restarts on file changes, ensuring a rapid development feedback loop.
*   **Automated Building (`build`)**: Effortlessly package your project into a distributable `.plasmoid` archive with a single, simple command.
*   **Code Formatting (`format`)**: Maintain pristine QML code quality and consistency with integrated `qmlformat` support.
*   **Smart Versioning (`changeset`)**: Implement robust version control and generate changelogs automatically using a powerful `changeset` system, simplifying release management.
*   **Extensible with Custom Commands (`commands`)**: Unleash limitless automation by writing your own project-specific commands in JavaScript, powered by Prasmoid's embedded runtime.
*   **Seamless Integration (`link`, `install`)**: Easily link your development plasmoid to KDE's local directories for testing, or install it system-wide for production use.
*   **User-Friendly Experience**: Enjoy interactive prompts, intelligent dependency checks, and clear command outputs for a smooth and intuitive development journey.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Prasmoid is designed for quick and easy installation. Choose your preferred method:

#### Recommended: Standard CLI

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PRASSamin/prasmoid/refs/heads/main/install | bash -s 1
```

#### Compact: Compressed CLI

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PRASSamin/prasmoid/refs/heads/main/install | bash -s 2
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some antivirus software may flag the compressed version due to its high compression ratio. This is a **false positive**. Both versions are completely safe and malware-free, with the compressed version being generated directly from the standard build.

### Your First Plasmoid Project

Creating a new plasmoid is incredibly simple with `prasmoid init`.

1.  **Run the initialization command:**

    ```bash
    prasmoid init
    ```

2.  **Follow the interactive prompts:** Prasmoid will guide you through setting up your project details:

    ```
    ? Project name: MyAwesomePlasmoid
    ? Description: A new plasmoid project.
    ? Choose a license: GPL-3.0+
    ? Author: Alex Doe
    ? Author email: alex@example.com
    ? Plasmoid ID: org.kde.myawesomeplasmoid
    ? Initialize a git repository? Yes
    ```

    Once completed, a new project directory will be created with your chosen configuration, ready for development!

## Command Reference

Prasmoid provides a comprehensive set of commands to manage your plasmoid projects.

| Command | Description | Usage & Flags |
| :------ | :---------- | :------------ |
| `init` | Initializes a new plasmoid project. | `prasmoid init [-n <name>]` <br> `-n, --name`: Specify the project name directly. |
| `build` | Builds and packages the project into a distributable `.plasmoid` archive. | `prasmoid build [-o <output_dir>]` <br> `-o, --output`: Specify a custom output directory (defaults to `./build`). |

| `commands remove` | Deletes a custom command. | `prasmoid commands remove [-n <name>]` <br> `-n, --name`: Specify the command name to remove. |

## Extending Prasmoid with Custom Commands

Prasmoid's most powerful and unique feature is its extensibility through custom JavaScript commands. This allows you to automate any project-specific workflow directly within your CLI, without needing Node.js installed on your system.

### How it Works: The Embedded JavaScript Runtime

Prasmoid includes a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript runtime embedded directly within its Go binary. This runtime provides a Node.js-like environment, offering synchronous APIs for common modules such as `fs`, `os`, `path`, `child_process`, and a custom `prasmoid` module for CLI-specific interactions.

This means you can write powerful automation scripts in JavaScript, and Prasmoid will execute them natively, making your custom commands fast, portable, and truly zero-dependency for end-users.

### Creating a Custom Command

1.  **Generate the command file:**
    ```bash
    prasmoid commands add deploy
    ```
    This will create a file like `.prasmoid/commands/deploy.js`.

2.  **Edit the file** to define your command's logic. Prasmoid automatically adds type definitions (`prasmoid.d.ts`) for autocompletion and type-checking in editors like VS Code.

    ```javascript
    // .prasmoid/commands/hello.js

    /// <reference path="../../prasmoid.d.ts" />
    const prasmoid = require("prasmoid");
    const fs = require("fs"); // Example: You can use fs module

    prasmoid.Command({
      // The main function to run when the command is executed
      run: (ctx) => {
        const name = ctx.Flags().get("name") || "World";
        console.green(`Hello, ${name}!`); // Use Prasmoid's colored console

        const args = ctx.Args();
        if (args.length > 0) {
          console.yellow("Arguments received:", args.join(", "));
        }

        // Example: Read a file using the embedded fs module
        try {
          const content = fs.readFileSync("somefile.txt", "utf8");
          console.log("File content:", content);
        } catch (e) {
          console.red("Error reading file:", e.message);
        }
      },

      // A short description shown in the help list
      short: "Prints a greeting.",

      // A longer, more detailed description for 'prasmoid help hello'
      long: "A simple command that prints a greeting. You can use the --name flag to customize the greeting.\n\nExample:\n  prasmoid hello --name 'Alice'",

      // Define command-line flags
      flags: [
        {
          name: "name",
          shorthand: "n",
          type: "string",
          default: "World",
          description: "The name to greet.",
        },
      ],
    });
    ```

3.  **Run your custom command:**
    ```bash
    $ prasmoid hello
    # Output: Hello, World!

    $ prasmoid hello --name "Prasmoid" an-argument
    # Output: Hello, Prasmoid!
    #         Arguments received: an-argument
    ```

### Available JavaScript Modules & APIs

The embedded runtime provides a subset of Node.js-like APIs, focusing on synchronous operations suitable for CLI scripting:

*   **`prasmoid`**: Custom module for CLI interactions.
    *   `prasmoid.Command(config)`: Registers a new command.
    *   `prasmoid.getMetadata(key)`: Reads values from `metadata.json`.
    *   `ctx.Args()`: Get command-line arguments.
    *   `ctx.Flags().get(name)`: Get flag values.
*   **`console`**: Enhanced logging with color support (`console.log`, `console.red`, `console.green`, `console.color`, etc.).
*   **`fs`**: Synchronous file system operations (`fs.readFileSync`, `fs.writeFileSync`, `fs.existsSync`, `fs.readdirSync`, etc.).
*   **`os`**: Operating system information (`os.arch`, `os.platform`, `os.homedir`, `os.tmpdir`, etc.).
*   **`child_process`**: Execute shell commands synchronously (`child_process.execSync`).
*   **`process`**: Process information and control (`process.exit`, `process.cwd`, `process.env`, `process.uptime`, `process.memoryUsage`, `process.nextTick`).
*   **`path`**: Utilities for working with file paths (`path.join`, `path.resolve`, `path.basename`, `path.extname`, etc.).

> [!NOTE]
> The embedded runtime currently supports **synchronous** file system operations only. Asynchronous functions (e.g., `fs.readFile`) are not implemented.
