prasmoid (0.1.0-1) plucky; urgency=medium

  * Commands with missing binary dependencies (e.g., qmlformat, curl) are now gracefully disabled and marked with an (disabled) tag in the help text.
  * Running a disabled command now prints a clear, user-friendly message explaining which dependency is missing.
  * The previous behavior of auto-installing dependencies has been removed to avoid crashes in different distributions. Similar to this issue
  * Added a new prasmoid fix command that runs a script to install all required dependencies for your distribution.
  * The setup command has been dropped in favor of the fix command.
  * The update checking mechanism has been completely rewritten to use SHA256 checksums for verification instead of version tags, ensuring notifications are always accurate.
  * The CLI's help message has been reorganized with a new "Maintenance Commands" group for better readability.
  * The main install and update shell scripts have been rewritten to be more robust, POSIX-compliant, and no longer depend on jq.
