Description: The All in One Development Toolkit for KDE Plasmoids.
 Prasmoid CLI
 .
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 Why Prasmoid?
 .
 While the core structure of KDE Plasma plasmoids is straightforward, the
 surrounding development workflow, including setup, building, testing,
 and deployment often involves repetitive manual steps. **Prasmoid CLI**
 is designed to abstract away these boring tasks. It's a powerful command-
 line tool, crafted with Go, that provides a seamless, integrated
 experience, allowing you to **focus solely on writing your plasmoid's
 code**.
 .
 **Focus on your code, not the boilerplate.** Prasmoid handles the heavy
 lifting, from project scaffolding and live previews to smart versioning
 and packaging, allowing you to concentrate on creating amazing
 plasmoids.
 .
 One of its most revolutionary features is a **built-in, zero-dependency
 JavaScript runtime**. This allows you to extend the CLI with your own
 custom commands, automating any workflow imaginable, directly within
 your project â€“ no Node.js installation required!
